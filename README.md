# DS7331_Project3
Group Project 3 for Data Mining course
March 30 - uploaded Jupyter notebook file with code to load data and examine files and data. Uploaded the data file in a zipped format. Unzipping produces a .csv file. This file needs to be re-coded as a unicode-8 file in order for python to upload it. This is simple by opening in Excel, resaving as a .csv file while opening the tools drop-down menu on the Save As popup screen and selecting "web options/encoding/unicode (UTF-8)" from there.
